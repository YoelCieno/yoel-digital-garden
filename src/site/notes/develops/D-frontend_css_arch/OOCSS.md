Object Oriented CSS (OOCSS)—and everything that comes with this paradigm shift—is the conceptual foundation for better interface design and development. It states that interfaces are made of multiple components, which should be re-used as much as possible.

Similar to object-oriented programming, **OOCSS focuses on flexible and reusable components, each doing one thing well**. This alone encompasses basic programming principles such as [single responsibility principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle), [separation of concerns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) and [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).

It also checks one essential UX and Graphic Design box: **Consistency**. By re-using a similar button design throughout the interface, users get familiar with it, and the app feels more intuitive each new session. With OOCSS, we’re merely re-using code, making it faster and easier to create more things, without adding significant overhead to the codebase. DRY CSS, people!
